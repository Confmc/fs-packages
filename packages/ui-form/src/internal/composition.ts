 * Vue's `vModelText` composition rule for a text field the component binds by hand: an IME composes
 * one character through several `input` events, none of which is the user's value, so nothing is
 * committed while composing and the field's value is committed once on `compositionend`.
 *
 * Bind the field's `:value` to `shown`, never to the model: Vue re-patches `value` on every render,
 * and the model is stale mid-composition, so any re-render then would wipe the candidate text.
 * `shown` holds the field's own text while composing — the job `vModelText`'s
 * `if (el.composing) return` does on update.

/**
 * happy-dom 20 ships no Popover API, and `useListbox` calls `showPopover()` unconditionally —
 * the API is Baseline (Chrome 114 / Safari 17 / Firefox 125) and a capability branch in source
 * would be permanently unreachable under the coverage gate, which runs happy-dom only.
 *
 * These stand-ins keep the unit suite on the real code path. They deliberately do NOT emulate
 * top-layer painting or `:popover-open` — that is layout, which happy-dom cannot do and which
 * the real-Chromium browser suite asserts instead.

/**
 * Loud accessor for a ref that is non-null by lifetime — a mounted template ref read from a
 * handler that only runs while the component is mounted. Returns the value; throws a named
 * `MissingRefValue` when the lifetime assumption is broken, instead of the anonymous
 * `TypeError` a bare `!` assertion produces at the same point. Same states fail, but the
 * failure names the assumption — and a spec can assert it.
 *
 * Mirrors emmie's `helpers/reactivity` helper of the same name (message included), so the
 * eventual emmie migration onto ui-inputs reads familiar code.
